## 📱 Overview
This is a **CRUD-based Android application developed** in Kotlin, integrated with Firebase Realtime Database.
The app supports both **Admin and Client** modules — allowing Admins to manage data (Create, Update, Delete) and Clients to view their personal entries.

The goal of this project was to understand **Firebase Realtime Database operations**, **role-based access**, and **clean app architecture** while developing a functional Android app from scratch.

## 🚀 Features
- **Admin module:** - Create new entries, view all client entries, update them, delete them

- **Client module:** - View their own data, limited access as compared to Admin

- **Real-time data sync:** - All changes are immediately reflected across connected clients using Firebase Realtime Database

- **Kotlin implementation:** - Full code written in Kotlin for modern Android development

- **Clean architecture:** - Logical separation of modules (Admin vs Client) and concerns (UI, data, model)

- **Firebase integration:** - Database operations, data retrieval and display
